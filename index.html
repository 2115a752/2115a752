<h1>DOG</h1>
<P>The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds. <b>Human beings have played a major role in creating dogs that fulfill distinct societal needs.</b> Through the most rudimentary form of genetic engineering, dogs were bred to accentuate instincts that were evident from their earliest encounters with humans. Although details about the evolution of dogs are uncertain,<i>the first dogs were hunters with keen senses of sight and smell</i> . Humans developed these instincts and created new breeds as need or desire arose.</P>

<p>
    Once it became evident that dogs were<b>faster
    </b>  and <b>stronger</b> and could see and hear better than humans, those specimens exhibiting these qualities were interbred to enhance such attributes.
     Fleet-footed sight hounds were revered by noblemen in the Middle East, while in Europe powerful dogs such as the mastiff were developed to protect home and traveler from harm.
    As society changed and agriculture—in addition to hunting—became a means of sustaining life, other breeds of dogs were developed. Herding and guarding dogs were important to farmers for protecting their flocks.
     At the same time, small breeds became desirable as<b> playthings and companions</b> for noble families.
      The Pekingese in<i> China and fragile </i>breeds such as the Chihuahua were bred to be lapdogs.
       The terrier breeds were developed, mainly in<u> England, to rid granaries and barns of rodents</u>. 
       Pointing and retrieving breeds were selected for special tasks related to aiding the hunter to find and capture game.
        Many breeds are extremely ancient, while others have been developed as recently as the 1800s.

<h1 id="sec3">SENSES</h1>
<p>
    Dogs have the same five senses as humans. However, some are more highly developed, and others are deficient compared with those of humans. Dogs’ sense of smell is by far the most acute and is immeasurably better than that of humans. Dogs are used for such tasks as tracking missing persons, digging underground, and tracing toxic substances, such as gases, that are undetectable by humans. Dogs can detect drugs, explosives, and the scents of their masters. Not all canine noses are the same, however. Some breeds, such as the German shepherd and the bloodhound, have much more keenly developed olfactory senses than others. One would not choose a short-nosed breed, such as the pug, to engage in tracking.

Even in short-nosed <b>breeds, however, the olfactory centre</b> is relatively highly developed. It is arranged in folds in order to filter smells from the incoming air. Some rescue dogs are trained to follow a scent on the ground, and others are trained to scent the air.<br> Both are able to distinguish one person from another even after a considerable passage of time. Hunting dogs—such as<mark> pointers, retrievers, and spaniels—are trained to scent birds and can distinguish one variety of bird from another</mark>.

The dog’s sense of taste is poorly developed compared with that of humans. If forced to live on their own, dogs will eat almost anything without much discrimination.
</p>
<h1 id="sec4">Breed Specific Behaviour</h1>
<p>There are <b>distinctive breed-typical personalities</b> that have been developed through generations of selection for certain traits.<br> By roughly grouping dogs according to the work they were bred to do, it is possible to determine the type of temperament a dog might have at maturity. Differences in breed personalities can be seen at an early age. Sporting dogs will generally be adventurous, following their noses wherever scents lead them, but will respond enthusiastically to calls from familiar humans.<br> Hounds generally tend to be more aloof and independent, inclined to scout the territory on their own and follow a scent or a movement;<mark> they are not as interested in human interaction as the bird dogs are.</mark>

    Working and herding dogs have more business-like dispositions. <br>They tend to evaluate situations and set about their tasks. Collie puppies have been known to<u> herd children, ducklings, or each other in an instinctive manifestation of their birthright</u>. Guarding dogs tend to be protective of their territories, even at an early age. Such dogs as the Maremma or the kuvasz, which are bred to guard flocks, are placed with the sheep from the time they are puppies in order to reinforce their basic protective instincts.<br> Collies and Akitas are known for their strong sense of loyalty. Terriers, bred to chase and catch rodents, have a tendency to be extremely active, lively, and feisty as puppies, traits that continue into adulthood. Newfoundlands are renowned for lifesaving instincts.</p>
